# 3D Rolling Disk Dynamics Simulation
A dynamics simulation I wrote when I was an undergrad at UW-Madison. It simulates a disk (size of a coin) rolling on a table. It includes the dynamics of the disk rotating in the air, a preliminary impact mapping as the disk hits the table, and the dynamics of the disk as it rolls on the table. Improvements could be made on the impact map and the rolling part (e.g., adding frictions).
Tested for MATLAB R2023a.
To run the simulation, open the main.m file and run.
